	<h2>Blowers Daughter</h2>
	<h4>Damien Rice</h4>
	<p>
	And so it is<br>
	Just like you said it would be<br>
	Life goes easy on me<br>
	Most of the time<br>
	And so it is<br>
	The shorter story<br>
	No love, no glory<br>
	No hero in her sky<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	I can't take my eyes off of you<br>
	I can't take my eyes off of you<br>
	I can't take my eyes off of you<br>
	I can't take my eyes off of you<br>
	I can't take my eyes off of you<br>
	I can't take my eyes...<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	And so it is<br>
	Just like you said it would be<br>
	We'll both forget the breeze<br>
	Most of the time<br>
	And so it is<br>
	The colder water<br>
	The blower's daughter<br>
	The pupil in denial<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	I can't take my eyes off of you<br>
	I can't take my eyes off of you<br>
	I can't take my eyes off of you<br>
	I can't take my eyes off of you<br>
	I can't take my eyes off of you<br>
	I can't take my eyes...<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	Did I say that I loathe you?<br>
	Did I say that I want to<br>
	Leave it all behind?<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	I can't take my mind off of you<br>
	I can't take my mind off of you...<br>
	I can't take my mind off of you<br>
	I can't take my mind off of you<br>
	I can't take my mind off of you<br>
	I can't take my mind...<br>
	My mind...my mind...<br>
	'Til I find somebody new <br>
